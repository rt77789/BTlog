title: Several things to do
---
<p class="indent">
	About this blog, I have several things to do to make it of a good look-feel and easily to use.
	<div class="margin20">
	0. Top K articles should be shown in main page.<br />
	1. Each article should be shown several lines.<br />
	2. Modify the default css file, it's not mine.<br />
	3. Customize the css & layout of comments of DisQus that belongs to me.<br />
	4. Syntax highlight for codes, 'ColdRay' is suitalbe.<br />
	5. Customize a rakefile to remote synchronize the articles.<br />
	</div>

	<p class="indent">
	Work of company isn't heavy these days, so I have a lot of time to do what I want; coding and reading articles on the internet is enough. At last, the most important thing is keeping up learning English, whatever. That's all, have a good time.
