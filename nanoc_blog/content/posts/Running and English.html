title: Running and Words
---
<p class="indent">
Last 2 weeks, I kept running more or less, though read some English words, I can't remember them all the same. Suddenly comes so much work, which makes me feel tired, and it will last several weeks until next month. Whatever I feel, the work I have to do and finish it, why not consider it as a improvement, just let it be.

	Running is the cheapest way to build up one's body, the only needed thing is keeping it on, the same as learning English words.
