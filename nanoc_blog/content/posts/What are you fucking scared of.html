title: What are you fucking scared of?
---
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too many things you are scared of are really nothing at all when you want to do some really interesting and valueable things, I got this sentence and felt it the whole day. Who cares you and what you did? None. If you wonder coding, just do it; if you wonder laughing, just do it; if you wonder crying, just do it... Don't ask me why I said this, the only reason for that is just WE ARE YOUNG.
