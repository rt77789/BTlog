I have to say most Chinese online music website are damned bad. First I listen to the music in top100.cn, but its resources (songs) aren't so good, so I baidu '在线音乐' (u know baidu said that he/she is the one who most knowing users in Chinese), and several ones list: '豆瓣' | '酷我' | '一听' and so on, the worst thing is none is good. Okay, I give up, enjoy the music is a hard thing for me, right?

Disqus comments application is used for this BTlog now, there're several things I haven't finished yet, 'haml' - I don't know how to control it well, 'CodeRay' - A syntax highlighting tool, I haven't added it to this BTlog yet, 'remote syn' - I should add a function that could automaticlly synchronize the remote website after creating a new article. It's very hard for me to write articles in English, everyone of my friends knows how poor is my English, but I'll keep up writing in English, not only it's necessery but a challenge and many funs. At last, just like before, share some words I liked : enemies can go there, then I can ('寇可往, 吾亦可往').
