	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a New Blog created by nanoc. I read the tutorial of nanoc, but it's a little hard to understand, so I found a sample of code as a 'code tutorial' -
<a href = "https://github.com/mgutz/nanoc3_blog" target="_blank">mgutz's nanoc blog.</a>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I learned how to create blog with nanoc by mgutz's code, I write all the code by myself line by line.
It's simple blog now, I writes very few codes, in the future I'll improve it, not only for fun, but also for u and me. ;D
Coding is a wonderful process, just like playing a net game, more funny than a net game.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No comments? Yes, it's only a static website(nanoc3? is a static webpages generator) without comments now.If u want leave a comment now, just go to another <a href="http://xiaoe.org" target="_blank">Blog</a> of mine created by wordpress. Maybe I'll use Disqus in some day. How to contact me? Just read the About page please.
