I have to say most Chinese online music website are damned bad. First I listen to the music in top100.cn, but its resources (songs) aren't so good, so I baidu 'Âú®Á∫øÈü≥‰πê' (u know baidu said that he/she is the one who most knowing users in Chinese), and several ones list: 'Ë±ÜÁì£' | 'ÈÖ∑Êàë' | '‰∏ÄÂê¨' and so on, the worst thing is none is good. Okay, I give up, enjoy the music is a hard thing for me, right? 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Disqus comments application is used for this BTlog now, there're several things I haven't finished yet, 'haml' - I don't know how to control it well, 'CodeRay' - A syntax highlighting tool, I haven't added it to this BTlog yet, 'remote syn' - I should add a function that could automaticlly synchronize the remote website after creating a new article. It's very hard for me to write articles in English, everyone of my friends knows how poor is my English, but I'll keep up writing in English, not only it's necessery but a challenge and many funs. At last, just like before, share some words I liked : enemies can go there, then I can ('ÂØáÂèØÂæÄ, Âêæ‰∫¶ÂèØÂæÄ').

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Disqus comments application is used for this BTlog now, there're several things I haven't finished yet, 'haml' - I don't know how to control it well, 'CodeRay' - A syntax highlighting tool, I haven't added it to this BTlog yet, 'remote syn' - I should add a function that could automaticlly synchronize the remote website after creating a new article. It's very hard for me to write articles in English, everyone of my friends knows how poor is my English, but I'll keep up writing in English, not only it's necessery but a challenge and many funs. At last, just like before, share some words I liked : enemies can go there, then I can ('ÂØáÂèØÂæÄ, Âêæ‰∫¶ÂèØÂæÄ').

		<p></p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a New Blog created by nanoc. I read the tutorial of nanoc, but it's a little hard to understand, so I found a sample of code as a 'code tutorial' - 
<a href = "https://github.com/mgutz/nanoc3_blog" target="_blank">mgutz's nanoc blog.</a>, I create a repository in github <a href="https://github.com/rt77789/BTlog" target="_blank">my nanoc BTlog</a>, before this I usually use svn to control my codes, Yes, it's old and not cool, git will replace it in the future for me.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I learned how to create blog with nanoc by mgutz's code, I write all the code by myself line by line.
It's simple blog now, I writes very few codes, in the future I'll improve it, not only for fun, but also for u and me. ;D
Coding is a wonderful process, just like playing a net game, more funny than a net game.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No comments? Yes, it's only a static website(nanoc3? is a static webpages generator) without comments now.If u want leave a comment now, just go to another <a href="http://xiaoe.org" target="_blank">Blog</a> of mine created by wordpress. Maybe I'll use Disqus in some day. How to contact me? Just read the About page please.
